        <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">"Piggy & Doggy: A Love Meant to Be"</h1>
        <p>We met as strangers, just two unknown,
High school days, where seeds were sown.
Then came lockdown, time stood still,
Yet we grew close, against our will.

Day by day, our bond just grew,
With laughs and talks, both old and new.
Somewhere along this beautiful way,
You took my heart without delay.

My piggy knows her doggy best,
More than she knows her own self’s quest.
His doggy knows her piggy true,
Better than he ever knew.

Our paths may lead to different sights,
With ups and downs and distant nights.
But in the end, through thick and thin,
Our love will always pull us in.

No matter where this journey goes,
Through summer sun or winter snows,
One thing is sure, one thing is clear—
We'll stay together, year by year.
FOREVER, LOVE YOU JAAN ❤️</p>
