        <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">"Piggy & Doggy: A Love Meant to Be"</h1>
        <p>We met as strangers, just two unknown, 
A simple “hi,” and seeds were sown.  
Classroom whispers, stolen glances,  
Fate had planned our sweet romances.  
Then came lockdown—world stood still,  
Yet our hearts moved against their will.  
Late-night talks and endless laughter,  
A love story written ever after.  

Piggy knows her doggy best,  
More than life's unpredictable tests.  
Doggy knows her piggy true,  
Like stars that guide the midnight blue.  
Now college calls, we chase our dreams,  
Walking paths like separate streams.  
Yet through the years, no matter where,  
Our love will find us—always there.  

In future days or distant lands,
No fate can break, no distance end,
A love like ours will just extend. 
No matter where this journey goes,  
Through summer sun or winter snows,  
One thing is sure, one thing is clear—  
We'll stay together, year by year. 
FOREVER, LOVE YOU MY PIGGY POG❤️</p>
